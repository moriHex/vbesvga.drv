;                                                                             ;
;  Given a set of points, draws a set of polylines connecting adjoining points;
;  This routine handles output to EGA as well as to BITMAPS (small or huge)   ;
;                                                                             ;
;  Breshenham's Run Length Slice algorithm is used to draw the lines. Though  ;
;  the algorithm is not derived here, the steps necessary in implementation   ;
;  are explained later.                                                       ;
;                                                                             ;
;  The way the algorithm works can be summarised below:                       ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . To draw any line we have to set on a set of  pixels which   ;
;                 fall on the line or are closest to it.In cases where a line ;
;                 passes exactly between two pixels, we resolve the tie by    ;
;                 setting on the lower pixel                                  ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . As a result of the above approximation, a line will actually;
;                 be drawn as a series of steps.                              ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . At any particular pixel position, the next pixel to set on  ;
;                 depends on the direction of progress and the slope of the   ;
;                 line, but because of the discrete movements, it can be the  ;
;                 next pixel in one of the following 8 directions:            ;
;                                                                             ;
;                             . Positive X / Negative X                       ;
;                             . Positive Y / Negative Y                       ;
;                             . Along one of the 4 diagonals in 1st, 2nd, 3rd ;
;                               or 4th quadrants.                             ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . Depending upon the slope of the line we will actually have  ;
;                 a series of pixels set on in one of the 8 directions, then  ;
;                 a move of 1 pixel in a second direction (one of above 8)    ;
;                 followed by another run of pixels in the first direction    ;
;                 , a move 1 pixel in the second direction and so on ...      ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . A line thus will have an AXIAL direction, along which most  ;
;                 of the pixels are set on and a DIAGONAL (to the axial) dir  ;
;                 which separates one run of pixel on the AXIAL direction     ;
;                 from the other                                              ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The AXIAL and DIAGONAL directions can be one of the above   ;
;                 8 directions, the exact directions can be calculated from   ;
;                 slope of the line and the direction of progress.            ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . To facilitate the calculation of the run lengths along the  ;
;                 AXIAL direction, we can rotate the line till the AXIAL dir  ;
;                 becomes the POSITIVE X axis and the DIAGONAL direction beco-;
;                 -mes the diagonal in the first quadrant.                    ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The steps to do the above rotation are:                     ;
;                                                                             ;
;                             . Translate to origin. Let the other end point  ;
;                               be at (Xf,Yf)                                 ;
;                             . Get the line into the first quadrant. So the  ;
;                               end point will now be (|Xf|,|Yf|)             ;
;                             . Get it below the slope=1 line. That is, inter-;
;                               -change the abscissa and ordinate of the end  ;
;                               point to ensure that the abscissa is >= the   ;
;                               ordinate. Let end point now be at (X,Y)       ;
;                             . If the line is above the slope=1/2 line, get  ;
;                               it below by making the end point to be (X,X-Y);
;                                                                             ;
;               . The line thus constructed will be in the same relative posi-;
;                 -tion wrt the +X axis and the 1st. quadrant diagonal, as the;
;                 original line was wrt it's AXIAL and DIAGONAL directions.   ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . If the pseudo line runs from (0,0) to (X,Y), we have to cal-;
;                 -culate the number of pixels to set on, on each of the hori-;
;                 -zontal scan lines at y=0,1,2,...,Y                         ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . Consider scan line at y=i 0<i<Y.                            ;
;                 If the line intersects the scan line at y=i-1/2 at x, then  ;
;                 the first pixel to set on, on the ith scan line is at       ;
;                 floor(x)+1 and the last is at floor(x + s) where s is the   ;
;                 inverse slope.                                              ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The run length on the ith scan line is thus:                ;
;                             floor(x+s) - floor(x)                           ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The idea behind the algorithm is to calculate these run len-;
;                 -gths and does so by using the run length on the previous   ;
;                 line and an error term.                                     ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . We finally get a series of run lengths, H0 on i=0, scan line;
;                 HY on the last scan line, and Hi on the intermediate ones.  ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The pseudo line was just used to calculate the run lengths. ;
;                 While drawing the line, we start at the original starting   ;
;                 point (not at origin) the first run of H0 is in the actual  ;
;                 AXIAL direction, a move of 1 pixel in the DIAGONAL dir,and  ;
;                 so on, till the last run of HY pixel on the AXIAL direction ;
;                 takes us to the actual end point of the line.               ;
;                                                                             ;
;                                                                             ;
;  Certain manipulations are made with the end points to make the code simpler;
;  These are:                                                                 ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . All lines will be drawn towards positive X axis, to do this ;
;                 we will swap the initial and final coordinates if necessary ;
;                 This will elliminate three directions of movement which inv-;
;                 -olve the negative X axis, leaving us with 5 directions.    ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . The code for drawing/moving along the diagonal or vertical  ;
;                 directions require the distance in bytes between one scan   ;
;                 line and the next. If we call the routine which draws in a  ;
;                 direction involving the positive Y axis, with the negative  ;
;                 of the scan line offset, it would actually draw in a the    ;
;                 corresponding direction involving negative Y                ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . With the above two manipulations, we need to implement rout-;
;                 -ines to draw in 3 basic directions, Positive X, Positive Y ;
;                 and the diagonal in the first quadrant.                     ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . Routines to move 1 pixel in the DIAGONAL direction are made ;
;                 separate as we will not set on any pixel during these moves.;
;                 We will thus have 3 move routines too, as the DIAGONAL dire-;
;                 -ction of the line could agagin be one of the 5 basic ones. ;
;                                                                             ;
;               . There are 4 sets of draw routines depending on the device & ;
;                 the type of the line. These are:                            ;
;                             . Solid Lines to EGA                            ;

;                 Routines are made separate as the organization of memory and;
;                 the method used to process the pixels are different.        ;
;                                                                             ;

;  For lines which are originally below the X axis, the metric of rounding    ;

;  pixel on the right instead of the one on the left. This is inconsistent    ;

;  cases by a minute amount to the left, so as to bias the ties infavour of   ;
;  required pixel but small enough so as to not affect the non-tie cases.     ;
